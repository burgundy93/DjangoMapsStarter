# DjangoMapsStarter

Just a basic Django App with Google Maps I made for myself since I screw up the code all the time and have to startover. Will save a lot of time just to git clone this everytime.

Remember to create a virtual environment (virtualenv) and install django within your virtual environment (pip install django). Also make sure you have Python 3 installed. 

Have fun hacking this. :)
